			<p>The Savannah Cat breed is a crossbreed of a domestic cat with an African Serval. Savannah Cats are characterized by their long, slender necks, triangular heads and large, wide ears that sit on top of their heads. They also have longer-than-average legs.</p><p>Savannah Cats are a lower-shedding breed, and so they require less grooming than long-haired breeds. Because of their playful nature, however, they may get into a mess and need a bath. Fortunately, they love water!Savannah kittens are often bottle fed for the first four weeks of their lives due to prematurity in first generations. After that, kittens should eat a complete and balanced dry kitten food to aid in growth and development over the next three years.</p>
